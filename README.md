# gdelt_articles
Project for Practical Data Science involving the GDELT dataset

The DataExploration folder contains several R markdown files that explore the data, as well as the locations of events from a subset of GDELT articles.

In the shiny folder are the server.R and ui.R files for the shiny app created using GDELT data. This app allows users to look at article sentiments and locations for the entire or filtered subset of the sample data.
